# Test technique

# **A simple gender reveal game app**


**Project Description**

  This application aims to allow the user to find the **gender (male/ female)**, the application will show a first-name on the screen, and the user must find the         gender of the first name displayed.   

  The user will start with a capital of **10 points**, if he gets the gender wrong answer, he loses a point else he will gain one, and if the user gets to **0           points**, he has   lost. If he gets to **20 points**, he has won and may decide to restart the game in the two cases. 
  




**Technologies used** 

  To perform this technical test, I used various technologies : 

  Front-end: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** et **EJS** 
  Back-end: **Node.js** (Express.js), **MongoDB** (database).

    cd BFM (name of the directory)

  In the project directory, you will have to run :
